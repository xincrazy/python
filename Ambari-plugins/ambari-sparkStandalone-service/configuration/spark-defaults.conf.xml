    <property>
        <name>spark.driver.memory</name>
        <value>1g</value>
        <description>
            Amount of memory to use for the driver process, i.e. where SparkContext is initialized. (e.g. 1g, 2g).
            Note: In client mode, this config must not be set through the SparkConf directly in your application,
            because the driver JVM has already started at that point. Instead, please set this through the --driver-memory
            command line option or in your default properties file
